This is a Quiz application, that have buttons, checks the total number of questions answered, checks if the answer was correct, and finally presents the score and summary

# Demo

![Quiz]()

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was developed previously for  Code&Coding, found on youtube with the title """Build A Quiz App Using ReactJS in 2022 || Including Hooks"""; although there is on youtube the same app developed by other people.

Despite that, I changed the current colors to softer colors; fixed the issue where questions would count multiple times if I kept pressing the right button; and next to the Score, I recorded the questions whose answers were correct.

# Technologies
In youtube's video this project was developed with javascript language using technology React_JS, and uuidv4.

However, in my devepoment used:
Msg-linter and comitzen for semantic version and Convencional Commits;  beyond the VS_Code with snippets.
