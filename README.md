This project was developed previously for  Code&Coding, found on youtube with the title """Build A Quiz App Using ReactJS in 2022 || Including Hooks"""; although there is on youtube the same app developed by other people.

Despite that, I changed the current colors to softer colors; fixed the issue where questions would count multiple times if I kept pressing the right button; and next to the Score, I recorded the questions whose answers were correct. The questions previous are stored inside questionsList.js file.
